# Backups & restore

A few minutes spent setting up backups now will save you a great deal of worry later. This page covers what to back up, how to do it safely, and how to restore when you need to.

:::tip The server is the source of truth
Openbeehive is offline-first, so every device that uses your hive keeps a full local copy of its data in the browser. That copy is a convenience, not a backup: it lives in the browser's storage and can be wiped by clearing site data, reinstalling, or losing the device.

For anything shared across people or devices, the **server** is the authoritative copy. Back up the server, and you protect everyone's records at once.
:::

## What to back up

There are two things on the server worth protecting:

| Item | Where it lives | Backup target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The database | SQLite file, or Postgres/MySQL | A consistent copy or dump |
| Blobs (photos, attachments) | Local filesystem, or MinIO/S3 | The blob directory or bucket |

Which database and blob store you have depends on your deployment profile:

- **`selfhost`** uses a single SQLite file and a local blob directory (`BEEHIVE_BLOB_DIR`, default `./data/blobs`).
- **`cloud`** uses Postgres and a MinIO/S3 bucket.

Back up **both** the database and the blobs. The database holds your apiaries, hives, queens, inspections and events; the blob store holds the files those records point to. A database backup without its blobs leaves you with broken image links.

## Backing up SQLite (selfhost)

SQLite stores your data in one file (for example `openbeehive.db`) plus two companion files when write-ahead logging is on:

- `openbeehive.db-wal` — recent changes not yet folded into the main file
- `openbeehive.db-shm` — shared-memory index for the WAL

:::caution Do not copy the `.db` file on its own while the server is running
With WAL enabled (the recommended setting), the newest data may still be in the `-wal` file. A plain `cp openbeehive.db backup.db` of a running database can produce an inconsistent or stale copy.
:::

You have two safe options.

### Option A — stop the service, then copy

The simplest reliable method. Stop Openbeehive so nothing is writing, copy all three files together, then start it again.

```bash
systemctl stop openbeehive

cp openbeehive.db     /backups/openbeehive.db
cp openbeehive.db-wal /backups/openbeehive.db-wal 2>/dev/null || true
cp openbeehive.db-shm /backups/openbeehive.db-shm 2>/dev/null || true

systemctl start openbeehive
```

The `-wal` and `-shm` files may not exist if the database has just been checkpointed — that is fine, hence the `|| true`.

### Option B — WAL-safe online backup (no downtime)

The SQLite command-line tool can take a consistent snapshot while the server keeps running, using the built-in backup API:

```bash
sqlite3 openbeehive.db ".backup '/backups/openbeehive.db'"
```

This writes a single, self-contained `.db` file that already includes everything from the WAL, so you do **not** need to copy the `-wal` or `-shm` files alongside it. This is the recommended approach for unattended backups.

## Backing up Postgres (cloud)

Use `pg_dump` to produce a logical dump. It is consistent without stopping the service.

```bash
pg_dump "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/openbeehive?sslmode=disable" \
  --format=custom \
  --file=/backups/openbeehive-$(date +%F).dump
```

The custom format compresses well and restores with `pg_restore`. For MySQL, the equivalent is `mysqldump --single-transaction`.

## Backing up blobs

### Local filesystem

Copy the blob directory. Files here are written once and not modified in place, so a recursive copy is safe even while the server runs:

```bash
rsync -a --delete ./data/blobs/ /backups/blobs/
```

### MinIO / S3

Mirror the bucket with the MinIO client or the AWS CLI:

```bash
mc mirror --overwrite myminio/openbeehive /backups/blobs/
# or
aws s3 sync s3://openbeehive /backups/blobs/
```

If you use a managed S3-compatible store, you can also rely on its own versioning or lifecycle policies as a second line of defence.

## Restoring

Restore the database and blobs together, then restart the service.

### SQLite

```bash
systemctl stop openbeehive

cp /backups/openbeehive.db ./openbeehive.db
rm -f ./openbeehive.db-wal ./openbeehive.db-shm   # let SQLite rebuild these
rsync -a --delete /backups/blobs/ ./data/blobs/

systemctl start openbeehive
```

Remove any stale `-wal`/`-shm` files before starting, so SQLite opens cleanly from the restored file.

### Postgres

```bash
pg_restore --clean --if-exists \
  --dbname="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/openbeehive?sslmode=disable" \
  /backups/openbeehive-2026-06-19.dump
```

Then restore the bucket or blob directory as above and restart the service.

:::note Devices re-sync automatically
After a restore, connected devices reconcile with the server in the background. Thanks to Hybrid Logical Clocks and conflict-free merging, devices that hold newer changes will sync them back in rather than losing them, and append-only events never conflict. There is nothing to do by hand on each device.
:::

## A simple cron schedule

A nightly job that snapshots the database and mirrors the blobs is enough for most self-hosters. Add this to your crontab with `crontab -e`:

```bash
# Nightly Openbeehive backup at 02:30
30 2 * * * sqlite3 /srv/openbeehive/openbeehive.db ".backup '/backups/openbeehive-$(date +\%F).db'" && rsync -a --delete /srv/openbeehive/data/blobs/ /backups/blobs/
```

The `%` characters must be escaped as `\%` inside crontab. For Postgres, swap the `sqlite3` call for the `pg_dump` command shown above.

:::tip Test your restores
A backup you have never restored is only a hope. Every so often, restore into a throwaway directory or test instance and confirm you can open the app and see your hives. Keep at least a few days of dated copies, and store one off-site (an external drive or remote bucket).

## Where to go next

- Set or check `BEEHIVE_DATABASE_DSN` and `BEEHIVE_BLOB_DIR` on the [Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration) page.
- Plan version updates on the [Upgrading](/self-hosting/upgrading) page — always back up first.
- Return to the [Self-hosting overview](/category/self-hosting) for the full deployment picture.
